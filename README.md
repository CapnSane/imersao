### Challenges

The challenges occur when the class ends a section. Until now it was three different challenges, that are written below.

#### The first challenge

The first challenge was about HTML. For studying the HTML basics, the challenge covers the use of pure HTML, notwithstanding some HTML features are no longer recommended, like _&lt;center&gt;_ or _&lt;font&gt;_, that are deprecated in HTML5. The challenge was create any webpage only using HTML.

#### The second challenge

The second challenge was about HTML and CSS. Here, the students needed to create from scratch the initial search Google page, but without the page functionalities, like the search box, functional links, etc. The students needed to use HTML5 and CSS without (or avoiding) the deprecated old HTML features.

#### The third challenge

The third challenge was about JavaScript. Here, the students needed to create from scratch the initial search Google page only using JavaScript. Again, without the page functionalities, like the search box, functional links, etc.
